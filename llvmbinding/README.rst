LLVM Bindings for Lua/Ravi
==========================

As part of the Ravi Programming Language, it is my intention to provide a Lua 5.3 compatible LLVM binding.
This will allow Lua programmers to write their own JIT compilers in Lua!

Right now this is in early development so there is no documentation. But the Lua programs here
demonstrate the features available to date.
